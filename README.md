# Summaries

When learning something new, I like to write a short summary about it. This also helps if you need to come back to it after not using things for a certain amount of time.
This repository holds all the helpful summaries I wrote plus some helpful code snippets.
I thought I make this public, maybe it helps someone.

**Use at your own risk.**
