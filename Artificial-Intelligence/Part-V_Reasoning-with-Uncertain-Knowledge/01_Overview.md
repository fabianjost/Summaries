# Part V: Reasoning with Uncertain Knowledge

This part addresses inference and agent decision making in particular observable environments, i.e. where we only know probabilities instead of certainties whether propositions are true/false.

## [Chapter 20: Quantifying Uncertainty](02_Chapter-20_Quantifying-Uncertainty)
Logic does not allow to weigh different alternatives and it does not allow to express incomplete knowledge. We therefore need other models to cope with problem were we have incomplete knowledge (partially observable environments).  
  
In this chapter we will focus on all the basic machinery at use in **Bayesian networks**.
