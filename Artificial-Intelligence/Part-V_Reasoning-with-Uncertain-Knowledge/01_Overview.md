# Part V: Reasoning with Uncertain Knowledge

This part addresses inference and agent decision making in particular observable environments, i.e. where we only know probabilities instead of certainties whether propositions are true/false.

## [Chapter 20: Quantifying Uncertainty](02_Chapter-20_Quantifying-Uncertainty)
Logic does not allow to weigh different alternatives and it does not allow to express incomplete knowledge. We therefore need other models to cope with problem were we have incomplete knowledge (partially observable environments).  
  
In this chapter we will focus on all the basic machinery at use in **Bayesian networks**.

## [Chapter 22: Making Simple Decisions Rationally](04_Chapter-22_Making-Simple-Decisions-Rationally)
**Decisions theory** investigates **decision problems**, i.e. how an agent a deals with choosing among actions based on the desirability of their outcomes given by a **utility function** on state.  
**Idea:** Rational decisions = choose actions that maximize expected utility (MEU).
